# Ruber-Ducky Code

This is an interchangeable rubber ducky script I wrote designed to run and execute various payloads. For demonstration purposes I’ve provided a safe version of the code you can run and script onto an arduino board that utilizes a micro USB port (The arduino Keyboard library only works with those types of boards). Simply load up the arduino program and sketch “KeyboardInjectionLINUX.ino” to the board and the sample code will run. I’ve also included a set of functions in a text file, that you can use to edit and swap out functions in the original code should you wish to. Have fun!!!
